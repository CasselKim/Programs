##  Basic Blocks

### Page : Create new page

When you create new page, Recommendation will guide you how to write easily.

you can add an emoji and cover on the top by clicking `Add Icon`  and  `Add Cover`, which can be changed whenever you want.

Also, writing title and comment is so easy and clean that it seems like blog and tistory.



### Text : Just literally text

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48755377/61880298-98990680-af2f-11e9-9df5-e4eee95dcb62.png)

When you select text, nothing happen. You can just write down your contents.



### The others

Similar with Markdown(Almost same, but not all)



1. **Heading(#)** : Same form of markdown, but no more than ###.

   Also same as markdown in **bold**, *italic*, but ~~strikethrough~~ is  `~sentence~`  different with markdown `~~sentence~~`.

2. **To-do-List( [] )** : write `[` and `]` sequentially.

3. **Bulleted List(*)** :  Unlike markdown, bulleted list can be deeper and deeper and I think it's endless.

   And you can easily select part of the list by dragging from top to the bottom

3. **Numbered List(1,2,)** : Same with markdown, but notion don't make numbered list after bulleted list  automatically.
4. **Quote(")** : Different with markdown. Quote shortcut in markdown is  `>` , `"` in notion.
5. **Toggle List(>)** : In fact, `>` in notion is toggle list which can hide and show contents.
6. **Divider(---)** : Same with markdown
7. **Link to Page** : Link to page
8. **Call out** : put the writing in a box
