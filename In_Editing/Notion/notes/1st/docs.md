When you download Notion, you can see this entrance page.

Select program you want to import

I select test & markdown of codingyahac for instance

(For my case, Import process takes too much time more than a minute. So I did reload by  `Ctrl + R`)

When I import my previous work which is made in Typora, It doesn't show as it is.

First image is cracked because of it's local path and other images are also loaded slowly.

(Left image is from Notion, Right from Typora)

Well, When I convert Markdown file from typora to notion, All of local path hyperlink has gone(of course)

And some change of table layout(Notion has more functions), removal of division line.



## Summary

I don't know exactly for now.

I think I use it more.
